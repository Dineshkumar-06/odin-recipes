    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Sambar is a traditional South Indian stew made primarily from toor dal (pigeon pea lentils) and tamarind broth, combined with a variety of vegetables. It is flavored with a unique spice blend known as sambar powder, which gives it a distinctive tangy and spicy taste. The dish is often tempered with mustard seeds, curry leaves, dried red chilies, and asafoetida, enhancing its aroma and flavor.</p>

    <p>This hearty and nutritious dish is a staple in South Indian cuisine and is commonly served with steamed rice, idli, dosa, or vada. Its preparation involves cooking lentils and vegetables separately before combining them with tamarind extract and spices, then simmering to develop a rich, complex flavor. Sambar is versatile, with many regional variations in ingredients and spice levels, making it a beloved comfort food across India and beyond.</p>
