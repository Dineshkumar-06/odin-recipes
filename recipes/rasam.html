    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Rasam is a classic South Indian soup-like dish known for its tangy, spicy, and aromatic flavors. Traditionally served as a side with rice, rasam is made with a base of tamarind or tomato, sometimes combined with cooked lentils, and seasoned with a blend of warming spices such as cumin, black pepper, mustard seeds, and curry leaves. Its thin, broth-like consistency and vibrant taste set it apart from other South Indian dishes like sambar, making it a staple in daily meals across the region.</p>

    <p>The preparation of rasam is both simple and versatile, allowing for variations based on local ingredients and preferences. Besides its delicious flavor, rasam is valued for its digestive properties and is often recommended for soothing colds and aiding digestion due to the medicinal qualities of its spices. Whether enjoyed as a soup or mixed with rice, rasam remains a comforting and nourishing part of South Indian cuisine.</p>
